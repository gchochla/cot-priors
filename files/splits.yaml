    they vastly overstate Macron's support. The larger than usual undecideds this

    can only mean that they are voting for the candidate that is socially uncomfortable
    to support. I'll give you two guesses as to who that is.

    more state employees for instance, much more than Macron''s. Thirdly, Fillon is
    leaning towards nationalism, whereas Macron is much more strongly pro-European.'

  : '3977'

    terrorism, not the ATTACKS themselves. Of course there is a threat, but this threat
    was there with Hollande, it would have been there with Le Pen too. What Macron
    wants (and what Le Pen wanted to do) was to protect the french from this THREAT
    and keep the ATTACKS from happening.

    who knows. The issue is that not everyone is given the same consideration. If

    tax rate is 100%. Economists and Arthur Laffer say to Melenchon, "lowering taxes
    will raise revenues!" But the commies respond "haha dumb conservatives, tax cuts
    don't pay for themselves." Commies start sharing Goolsbee memes making fun of
    people who'd lower taxes. Melenchon passes a bill increasing the marginal tax
    rate to 110%.

  ? It's too early to say. Macron's big promises were that he could improve the economy
    and also reform the EU. If he can deliver, then he will see continued support.
    If his government can't then there will probably be an increase in support for
    the FN as well as La France insoumise(Melenchon's party). The main support for
    Le Pen and Melenchon came from people who are upset about France's economic troubles
    so if that continues then the support will continue and probably grow.

    &gt;Centrism causes fascism to spread, even though a centrist is going to beat
    a fascist right now. But next time though! You''ll see!


    Comments like this make it obvious they want Macron to fail so fascism can spread
    and they can feel smug while people die.'

    supporters who voted for Trump to me. I am a social democrat myself and I would
    rather vote for a centrist than a far right politician. Don't get me wrong though,
    I am not trying to tell you what to do as I honestly don't even know as much about
    the French political scene as I would like. For the record, what's the deal with

  She can actually get fined for impeding an emergency vehicle..: '12030'
  She can bail herself out and go shit on his desk now: '14467'

    she and her bf "check all of each other's boxes".
  : '12035'
  She clearly thinks it is true. That's indication of mental illness.: '11643'
  She could always adopt. She's not the one who cares about genetics right?: '11076'
  ? She could have slept in the bed of her girlfriend, but decided that she would
    rather sleep beside him. That just seem off. She normally wouldn't even sleep
    in the same bed as her girlfriend and would take the couch. Isn't there a possibility

    and blank/null votes. That''s 12% of the people that showed up voting to say they
    didn''t like either option. All time high in France.

    etc advocate with Merkel pulling the strings. Le Pen, I would speculate, would
    be for a EU that exists in reality but is dysfunctional. She''s advocating border
    controls that already exist from Austria to Denmark. The reality is Merkel unilaterally
    promoted a policy that resulted in millions of muslims and the majority, including
    Le Pen wants nothing to do with them. '

    the two best-scoring candidates. Current polling says that Macron would win from
    Le Pen by about 20-25% difference, although apparently a large part of voters
    is still undecided. Macron is definitely favoured to win over Le Pen, but the

    more from side to side.  Even after all that, Macron is solid and sharp.  He''s

    Her politics would be normalised, her political ideology would have an enormous
    platform, the entire political spectrum would move in her direction as other politicians
    try to capture some of her votes.


    I think you''re mistaken if you believe her presidency would be a failure because
    she doesn''t have parliament. She would likely cause great polarisation, with
    parts of society becoming radically anti-Le Pen and the mainstream of politics

  Welfare and disability are pennies and scraps. Not the economy servicing someone..jesus.: '14209'
  ? Welfare state, a jobs guarantee, UBI, socialized housing programs, any combination
    of the above...there's *always* money to give the richest people tax breaks and
    keep the military industrial complex profitable, so the issue is not resources,
    the issue is that resources are being poorly allocated to benefit a small number
    of people at the expense of everyone else.
  : '17114'
  ? Well Chirac never said his ideal politican was Margaret Tatcher. Like with the
    left wing side, there is many political currents on the right wing and Fillon
    is on the extra scary one.

  : '5990'
  ? Well as I said, he is a sane choice, but he is not a "safe" conventional choice,
    which would usually be an establishment candidate like Valls or Fillon. Additionally
    he has his own party, En Marche, so he will be more able to carry out his campaign
    promises rather than having to submit to a major party's wishes.

  ? Well either one of them are crappy. You have a socialist that doesn't acknowledge
    muslim terrorism and another socialist who wants to deport all muslims. Conservative
    candidate, Fillon, lost in 1st round. In my opinion he was the best option to
    get France out of debt and bring some liberty into France.

  : '3040'

  : '12758'

    you wonder.


    **Edit:** The motive would also be pretty clear in this case. A Le Pen win would
    mean dissolution of the EU. The Russian economy would benefit enormously from
    this, as it is only smaller than a unified Europe.'

    \ shit, different words.\n\n"
  : '1669'

    people definitely are terrorists but to some degree they are fascist as well
  : '14986'
  Well they were a lot more like to vote for Le Pen than pensioners.: '6607'
  ? Well this is genuine nazism following the Nuremberg protocols or whatever is it
    called that classifies races etc. but I don't think this is what they really are.
    And even if they are, this is not why they have a lot of people supporting them
    and should the Le Pen or Wilders try ressurecting oldschool nazism, 99% of supporters
    would turn against them. Not to mention Wilders is mixed race and would have second
    thoughts about purging himself.
  : '68'

    the way they are overreacting is hilarious. They think Muslims are being literally
    "imported" into Europe like some sort of commodity.

  : '7245'
  ? Well unless you go back for doctorate and teach there isn't a lot of demand. I
    loved history throughout school and still read quite a bit. But it's limited in
    direct application so I decided a business degree to pay for buying history books
    and trips was a better deal. And it didn't make something I enjoyed a job instead.
    That said, the degree doesn't always matter. One of my peers in management has
    a history/teaching degree and does product management now.
  : '17365'

    a SD is supposed to do : promote social democracy. '

  : '17116'
  ? Well when you make moronic statements that aren't worth arguing against, what
    do you expect? Just because Macron doesn't want to declare an all out war on Islam
    doesn't mean he's an '''''SJW''''' or that he thinks everyone who hates Islamic
    terrorism is racist. If you genuinely want to put across a political point that
    will be taken seriously, don't say stupid shit.
  : '7132'
  ? Well while that might be true, in this case the woman's preference was to not
    be fucked by a man boy so she ended it. I think that's fair enough.
  : '11616'
  ? Well with Macron winning the first round in France, and D66 and GroenLinks (left
    neoliberal greens) gaining big in Holland, I hope they get the message. There
    is no way the urban, educated people will vote for hard left against the centre
    left. And Macron did well in middle class and above areas in cities

  : '1578'
  Well, Bretagne, the French place with the least Muslims, also votes Le Pen the least.: '5824'

  Well, Macron probably has some sort of Oedipus complex. So i guess he does fall into the 2nd part of my sentance lol: '3199'

  Well, Merkel and Macron want to sanction Poland for not accepting enough Muslim refugees.  That's doing something!  /s: '4314'

    works better. But if something's actually a dealbreaker and you're planning on
    treating it that way, call it what it is.

  ? Yeah agree. Not a fan of Melenchon, but it's crazy how much more shit his voters
    are getting compared with Fillon's, given that Fillon's defected in a greater
    proportion to fascism. Guess that it hurts Melenchon supporters here to be more
    noisy.
  : '1629'
  ? Yeah although if it backfires it'll only harden France's attitude against Russia.
    Not a huge deal for Russia if they don't expect any significant additional damage
    from it though. Plus the potential reward of a Le Pen presidency is a major win
    for them, basically it'd be the end of the EU and a Putin supporter leading the
    second most powerful country in the EU.

  ? Yeah but Melenchon's to the left so once his base grows older they'll moderate
    toward Macronesque policies, like generations before them. Anyway, if you win
    by 33pts you're not a divided nation, you're winning by a margin that makes Reagan-Mondale
    look small. That's not a temporary setback, that's an absolute crapping on. The
    French don't like the far right. If they did, she'd be President. If she would
    ever be president, she would've gotten more than 35%.
  : '5536'
  ? Yeah but atleast 90% of trumps lies are just him exaggerating a bit. Instead of

    \ super fucking disturbed"
  : '15341'
  ? Yeah but that would require principle and not just being self-absorbed and feeding
    off of the acquisition of power. Le Pen is a demagogue. She has no shame, no moral

    lost isnt even a thing anymore. It's an odd feeling.
  : '9463'
  ? 'Yeah like how neoliberal either means 1) someone more liberal than outright socialism
    2) small government free-market fundie ala Thatcher, Reagan, Bush, GoP, Fillon


    '
  : '2962'
  ? Yeah man so much winning. Like the Muslim ban... Oh wait how about the AHCA...
    Well how about those tax cuts... Uh well at least Le Pen won... Shit.
  : '2044'
  Yeah man, if we don't stop with this Le Penn might win!: '3704'
  ? "Yeah most French people on Facebook comment threads are saying that M\xE9lenchon\
    \ won, but a Reuters journalist wrote an article concluding that Macron won, a\
    \ sentiment I haven't actually heard much. "
  : '4657'
  ? "Yeah no shit. I\u2019m sick of the media like going around in circles trying\
    \ to figure out whether or not Trump actually means what he says. He does. Take\
    \ his words as sincere and hold him accountable."
  : '15629'
  ? 'Yeah no, drugging people is awful.


    Can''t believe the comments.'
  : '10882'
  Yeah right, it's mainly a gay sex thing, but you totally thought I meant animals right?: '12248'
  ? Yeah right. I'm 30 and I've been making "small incremental improvements" and the
    45 hour work week still makes me want to kill myself. I think it's a bad idea
    to tell people "it gets better" because when it doesn't,  that person is going
    to blame themselves for the systemic failing of our cultural values. I had better
    working conditions when I was 21 than I do now, and only slightly higher pay.
    Our society is in a downward spiral.
  : '12797'
  ? 'Yeah same here, nobody talks about people in the center because they are usually
    well off and don''t spend they entire time complaining how everything is terrible.
    Macron was voted in office by the cities and the well educated in majority (ie:
    the France that does well, the France that works).'
  : '139'
  ? 'Yeah so LePen is just nothing alike Trump (not saying i root for her either)
    and Macron is definitely not alike Hollande.

    Try again'
  : '3753'
  Yeah so charities are racist because only white folks want to volunteer.: '15146'
  ? 'Yeah stick it to those globalists, Macron!


    EDIT: Did I do something wrong? Is there a sub for people who are misinformed
    in politics and just want to joke around about shit?'
  : '6496'
  ? "Yeah sure but you said \u2018we can\u2019t tolerate racism\u2019 and he literally\
    \ stood up against it, sure he insulted him but that seems pretty minor given\
    \ the sons comment"
  : '8055'
  ? 'Yeah sure.


    I would remain careful because this speculation is currently under investigation
    and the smear campaign against Hillary laid the groundwork before the leaks. It
    appears plausible that Russia finds something to leak about Macron with the right
    timing as an attempt to interfere in this election as well.'
  : '485'
  ? 'Yeah that was my point. Maybe Hillary is more sympathetic to populists but Obama
    isn''t some perfect neoliberal either.


    I''m hoping Macron won''t make those mistakes, right now he seems better than
    both.'
  : '1874'
  ? Yeah that was such a bizarre moment. Even though this happened at the end and
    Le Pen's performance was an absolute train-wreak up until that point, I was *still*
    taken aback by how ridiculous she was.
  : '287'
  'Yeah that was unclear. I just meant someone who was good at more than just policy. Like Macron for example. ': '4398'
  ? "Yeah that's what the data from last week showed. However, it wont stop the \"\
    this parliament doesnt represent the people\" BS. \n\nI agree it's not Macron's\
    \ fault, or his voters, but still it's not a good look. "
  : '6887'
  ? "Yeah that\u2019s absolutely fair. Especially after so much time has passed it\
    \ could be retraumatizing for her.\n\nEdit: accidentally repeating myself"
  : '9558'
  ? "Yeah that\u2019s bullshit. \n\nSocialism is a perfectly fine solution too. Removing\
    \ or taxing passive income and redistributing income to cover basic needs and\
    \ reduce inequality works better than primitivism."
  : '14882'
  "Yeah that\u2019s fair.  Or require him to eat his vegetables...": '10704'
  ? 'Yeah the HuffPost projects Macron has a 98 % chance to win


    '
  : '5606'
  Yeah the crazy thing here is people pretending the US was ever a representative democracy tbh.: '17141'
  ? 'Yeah the economist have been climbing all over Macron for weeks. He''s a technocrat,
    and will probably be good for EU stability. Philon kind of became the french Ed
    Milliband this time out. '
  : '4192'
  ? "Yeah the short lived new president said Zyklon B couldnt be used to kill jews\
    \ because it has a too important cool down. He's been replaced by another guy.\
    \ \n\nA french fact checker said that Le Pen is through the roof with lies and\
    \ fake news. "
  : '3745'
  Yeah there are plenty of local elections and ballot issues that are important too.  There's never an excuse not to vote.: '15205'
  ? Yeah they all want hyper social normies that they find likeable. If you are ugly,
    socially awkward, have non normie interests or whatever they won't even consider
    hiring you. I swear many times I could tell they didn't hire me because they didn't
    like me or my face and I wouldn't fit in their clique of coworkers.
  : '17715'
  ? Yeah they should try the [final solution Le pen's family has been supporting since
    forever.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) Her family is a bunch of
    deniers that sold out their fellow french to the nazis.
  : '158'
  Yeah this comment will do wonders to convince her supporters they should support Bernie /s: '16915'
  ? Yeah this is the shit people don't understand. You are constantly comparing yourself
    and your performance to someone who has years of insight and experience. You don't
    learn a new skill in 5 minutes and suddenly you're on par with the guy who has
    10k hours doing it. It takes time and a ton of failure to get good at something.
    As soon as you are ok with being unproductive and failing at something, you'll
    be that much happier with the success you have.
  : '13591'
  ? "Yeah this kind of event is the worst thing that can happen politically speaking\
    \ before the election. \n\nLe Pen is going to get a hell of a boost based off\
    \ the last few days\n\n"
  : '1780'
  Yeah this looks like some Gen Z made this with poor source material and a vague knowledge of the 80s.: '11500'
  ? Yeah true. Marine Le Pen is a better communicator than her father. THe problem
    is that some people truly thinks she's a better person.
  : '1293'
  ? 'Yeah we do want to massively reduce/halt Islamic immigration. Far right parties
    want to do that. Far right parties like UKIP and the FN definitely don''t want
    to reduce immigration completely. Farage "we need more Indians and less Eastern
    Europeans and Muslims" certainly doesn''t want no immigration. Le Pen extensively
    campaigned in migrant communities. '
  : '3075'
  Yeah we should make it acceptable to bully and shame fucking scabs: '13750'
  ? Yeah we surprise each other quite often. This isn't the first time I've talked
    to his boss about some time off for a surprise either and he's done the same for
    me.
  : '10333'
  ? Yeah what Le Pen did was strictly illegal while Fillon did something theorically
    legal but highly immoral. She's not just suspected of that, it's been proven and
    she's being punished for it already
  : '5025'
  ? Yeah what SHE did years ago in a culture where black face isn't recognized as
    being a terrible thing. Much of Eastern Europe is just now catching up on race
    issues and the discussions that have been had in America and most of western Europe
    for decades.
  : '10800'
  "Yeah what the fuck. If I was a mother and I found out my sons were doing this I\u2019d absolutely lose my shit.": '8741'
  Yeah when she said she felt like a waitress I was like....ok but did his legs stop working?: '12008'
  ? "Yeah why are so many conservatives on here naive as fuck? The Dems aren\u2019\
    t stupid, they are doing this on purpose. None of it is an accident from withholding\
    \ the footage to overcharging the officers.\n\nThe video was leaked, we were never\
    \ supposed to see it. These people want the country destroyed and under their\
    \ control. Wake the fuck up, this will never stop, rolling over and making \u201C\
    it\u2019s just them\u201D excuses will get us all fucked.\n\nThey control what\
    \ is being taught to our kids and they control the media and continue spoon feeding\
    \ them as adults."
  : '12899'
  ? "Yeah you could say that, and in terms of success (and age ! ) more comparable\
    \ indeed, but is Bernie really that far left ? I mean, Melenchon would raise income\
    \ tax to 90 % above 400k\u20AC/year, nationalize energy companies and airports,\
    \ increase public spending to 70 % of GDP... Can Bernie really compete with that\
    \ ? "
  : '3832'
  ? "Yeah you\u2019re just missing the point. My wife considers seeing me sexualized\
    \ and naked to be an intimate thing, as I do her. We both enjoy the exclusivity\
    \ of that. Neither of us considers watching a stranger in a video naked to be\
    \ something that creates intimacy between me and that stranger. \n\nHe\u2019s\
    \ entitled to share that view. She\u2019s entitled to not. Just means there\u2019\
    s a compatibility issue and nothing else."
  : '10519'
  Yeah! But it's annoying because it will feed the narrative that Macron has not a real mandate.: '6799'
  ? "Yeah! Just like all those judges tried to censor your \u2018legal defenses.\u2019\
    \n\nYour head\u2019s been leaking, Giuli."
  : '16422'
  Yeah, 200 hours of torture. Sounds pretty horrible and extreme, not a great way to have perspective on normal life.: '16174'
  ? Yeah, 49% of the nation chose the leader. Somehow I think I can separate the two.
    Because 33% of French people voted for Le Pen doesn't mean that I suddently hate
    1/3 of my country's population, I just dislike the person they voted for.
  : '4656'
  ? Yeah, 90% of the GOP senate are fully compromised and really unworthy of office.   It's
    a conundrum.  Thank god Trump lost in November, or we'd all be doomed.   More
    so, that is.
  : '16505'
  'Yeah, Austria did stand firm when the rush of Trump winning and Le Pen rising was at it''s peak. ': '5973'
  'Yeah, France has enough of a problem integrating Muslims as it is. Le Pen would dial that alienation up to 11. ': '3292'
  ? 'Yeah, I am wondering the same. The message on the banner isn''t necessarily anti
    Le Pen, it''s just about upholding liberty, equality and brotherhood. '
  : '1823'
  ? "Yeah, I feel like pizza back when I was a kid tasted so much better. I love pizza,\
    \ but I feel like I can never find that one great pizza now....I\u2019m still\
    \ searching, lol."
  : '11761'
  Yeah, I guess I can't fault people for siding with nostalgia on r/nostalgia.: '9870'
  ? 'Yeah, I really don''t think Lindner is up there with Macron and Trudeau.


    The FDP is in its policies and and rethoric still more about representing the
    interests of their upper middle class voter base than about pushing for more evidence-based
    liberal policies. Also, they are really prone to use the dog whistle on immigration
    and at best lukewarm on the EU.'
  : '3163'
  ? 'Yeah, I remember that controversy.  Votebuilder access was restored in something
    like a week, after someone at the Sanders campaign downloaded segregated Clinton
    data he shouldn''t have had access to.


    Do you, or do you not, have any information to show that in the 2020 primaries,
    Votebuilder data has been withheld from the Sanders campaign?'
  : '16215'
  ? Yeah, I was lukewarm about him at first (preferred him over Le Pen, of course,
    but his free market liberal politics didn't really appeal to me), but after seeing
    that he's able to stand up to Trump and Putin, he has my support.
  : '870'
  Yeah, I'll totally show empathy to an employer who will never show me even the slightest bit in return. /s: '16899'
  Yeah, I've absolutely stopped caring about my work attitude. Everyone knows I don't want to be there. Fuck em: '14456'
  Yeah, Le Pen got crushed to a legendary degree by a liberal.: '970'
  'Yeah, Le Pen is an unwilling participant but extremists definitely want her and similar politicians to get in power. ': '4718'
  ? 'Yeah, Melenchon''s EU reforms are completely silly and would never be accepted.


    Political control of the ECB (including forcing them to give every EU country
    unlimited funds), deliberate currency manipulation, ending the EU''s free market
    approach, ending budgeting rules, stuff like that.


    Cameron tried to cross 1 red line, Melechon is going to cross all the others.

    '
  : '1351'
  Yeah, Trump showing any sort of restraint or logic isn't really on brand for him...: '15313'
  ? "Yeah, and his supporters like are all sexually repressed sycophants.  They love\
    \ to imagine themselves living Trump\u2019s lifestyle.  The thought of underage\
    \ prostitutes would just make them more infatuated with the orange idiot."
  : '17058'
  ? 'Yeah, and if we judge Le Pen solely on her own actions recently, take aways her
    father, she''s a white supremacist, nazi sympathiser. She''s not hiding it. '
  : '6709'
  ? Yeah, as SashaMonkey wrote, this sort of thing happens pretty often. Both with
    planes and ships (and for that matter, planes buzzing ships).
  : '1050'
  ? "Yeah, as a French I'm getting really tired of reading people with absolutely\
    \ no idea of how our politics work explain that \"WE have Trump as a president\
    \ now, so Marine Le Pen can be elected in France too!!\" No, there is absolutely\
    \ no chance and the 2 elections are completely different. \n\nThe comparison with\
    \ Brexit, a \"Yes or No\" referendum, is so ludicrous that I just feel sorry for\
    \ people being so dumb to even think the Leave choice in the UK can give some\
    \ foresight of our presidential election."
  : '6880'
  ? Yeah, at what fucking gas station do the customers come first? Never been in one
    where they treated customers with any sort of nicety or urgency. Sometimes they
    straight up ignore you standing at the register because they're doing other shit
    and there's nobody else scheduled. That or they didn't show up. You want both
    done? Hire more people. I would have quit as well. Fuck your boss.
  : '12857'
  ? 'Yeah, but even there they are extremely mild. They claim they would prefer a
    "more social EU" and that that''s why so many want to leave the EU, but they would
    never push for a "Spexit".


    Melenchon is a lot more anti EU for example'
  : '7122'
  ? 'Yeah, but even though ensuring basic human rights for everyone is a principle
    tennet of marxism , socialism and communism its not just limited to those.


    Hamon also rallied for universal basic income and some quite left wing proposals,
    but he wasnt a Marxist either.


    What I want so say is that even though he probably is a Marxist, his political
    program is not.'
  : '3744'
  ? 'Yeah, but it''s ok to call for white genocide or the "cleansing" of Trump supporters
    from society.  Those are acceptable calls to violence.  Just like burning down
    businesses and taking multiple city blocks in the name of antifa or blm is "the
    summer of love" and "mostly peaceful", but an unarmed group being escorted in
    by security to the capitol is "terrorism".


    Establishment hypocrisy knows no bounds it would seem...'
  : '12584'
  Yeah, but there will be legal ramifications for Macron's insider trading. It just won't happen immediately.: '6464'
  ? "Yeah, but they compose only 7% of our population. And most of them aren't that\
    \ much religious (except in the poor areas). \n\nIt's just that after Macron's\
    \ election, T_D was extremly salty. And your comment is exactly what an far right\
    \ american would have say. That and this kind of [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/69t5bb/congratulations_to_the_next_leader_of_france/) "
  : '1041'
  ? "Yeah, but... they cannot pass anything without McConnell, period. \n\nI\u2019\
    m not saying they don\u2019t suck, but the system needs to be fixed. Literally\
    \ NOTHING can get passed without McConnell."
  : '16027'
  Yeah, considering we have more daily cases now than ever and most places still aren't enforcing masks or shutting down...: '14147'
  ? Yeah, everyone will rally around Macron in the second round. Fillon and Hamon
    have both endorsed him. Polling shows him ~20% ahead.
  : '4864'
  ? 'Yeah, expansionary economic policies, immigration reform, and throwing a wrench
    in the Orwellian style media was a real fuck up. However did I not vote for the
    war criminal? /S


    But seriously, if France elects Le Pen, then the dishes are done. Probably better
    that way since the undemocratic EU government doesn''t actually have the sort
    of control necessary to create infrastructure and properly invest in Greece to
    merit a return anyhow. '
  : '5443'

  : '347'
  ? 'Yeah, he''s closer to Le Pen.


    He''s pro Assad, he''s anti free trade, anti EU, wants to dramatically increase
    public spending, pro Putin , and wants to lower the retirement age to 60.'
  : '2772'
  Yeah, hopefully Le Pen can stop violent anti-fa protestors from harming more innocents. Damn bigots.: '6029'
  ? Yeah, i can imagine the sister would start trying to get all the prizes that she
    should have won back, would have started making a scene, throwing shit around.
  : '12304'
  Yeah, if this isn't blatant destruction of evidence, I don't know what is. Michigan is beyond corrupt.: '14889'
  ? 'Yeah, im no poly expert but it sounds like shes just fucking a bunch of guys
    simultaneously no strings attached.


    Which is absolutely fine, but doesn''t constitute a relationship.


    It also sounds like the lack of commitment thing isn''t something that''s necessarily
    her choice (I presume because shes unbearable)'

    online security protection of a fly swat at this point.

    her and treating her like his servant. I know that one was too ridiculous to be
    real, especially with all the edits (he somehow managed to find it at a landfill
    but she dumped him anyway), but it pissed me off nonetheless.
  : '8369'
  ? Yeah, it's funny when you're a kid and your parents are broke you're just like,
    this sucks can't we get something better, but you don't actually process the fact
    that you CAN'T, it just seems like your parents are holding out for no good reason.
  : '7251'
  ? 'Yeah, it''s not just in the USA, it''s the same argument absolutely everywhere.


    Brexit? Real British people against the North London elite.


    Le Pen? Real French people against Muslims and urban elites.


    Apparently, to be a real person, you need to be white "working class", otherwise
    your life and experiences shouldn''t count.'
  : '3683'
  ? Yeah, it's weird how 2 'once in a lifetime' recessions, crippling student loan
    debt, sky high house prices and living costs, stagnant wages, the resurgence of
    fascism, a climate emergency and a global pandemic can fuck with our libido and
    our desire to bring life into this world. We are so fucking selfish...
  : '16827'
  ? 'Yeah, lol. Think I ate a 10pc nugget &amp; a large fry almost every shift I ever
    worked. Just grab one or 2 as you walk by. It adds up quick after a few hours.

    the shitty policies that right-wing populists wanna pursue are much more immediately

  Yeah, of course. It wasn't even supposed to be anti Le Pen. It was just the annual 1st of May marche by a workers union.: '5459'
  ? Yeah, pretty much. I don't think he'd be my president of choice (I'm waiting to
    see his program), but if it's a choice between him and Fillon or Le Pen, you can

    \ worse option than what they're doing if you actually want to fight terrorism.\n"
  : '1544'
  ? "Yeah, that\u2019s bullshit honestly. I think that stuff applies if say, somebody\
    \ alienated their friends because of their drinking and then makes amends etc;\
    \ not for stuff like sexual assault and manslaughter imo. \n\nI think you did\
    \ the right thing and a lot of people would have done the same in your position.\
    \ You\u2019re NTA."
  : '11440'
  ? Yeah, the Democrats are formally giving Pence an opportunity to cut ties with
    Trump and save himself. If he doesn't, then once Trump is accused of sedition
    Pence will be in the firing line for aiding and abetting.
  : '16991'
  Yeah, the US government pretty much. Somehow I've gotten 3 jobs civil service before I figured that out.: '13239'
  ? "Yeah, the crooked Hillary slogan. Even though everyone knew she probably wasn't\
    \ very honest and pretty reckless with emails, the crooked thing stuck even though\
    \ they never proved she broke the law. \n\nFillon, on the other hand, appears\
    \ to have been caught with his pants down. Employing his wife and now a criminal\
    \ probe. Not good. Le Pen must be clicking her heels after seeing this poll. "
  : '1642'
  "Yeah, the left is basically doomed unless M\xE9lenchon and Hamon create a coalition with a common platform and candidate. ": '1882'
  ? Yeah, the only thing that makes me think Le Pen can win are the academics that
    said brexit and Trump would happen also said le pen will happen, but they could
    be wrong too.
  : '5943'
  ? Yeah, the sad part is, these same democrats that are leaving will move to the
    burbs (where I am) and push for the same policies and types of leaders that encouraged
    and allowed these riots to happen.
  : '17723'
  ? Yeah, the stupid notion that everything must be "earned" because if anyone got
    something for free, the universe would implode.
  : '16802'
  Yeah, there's a real fine role model. A real peach.: '14417'
  ? "Yeah, there\u2019s absolutely nothing dramatic about that. \n\nShe sounds pretty\
    \ self absorbed if she thinks him informing her about your relationship is dRaMa.\
    \ What the fuck does y\u2019all\u2019s relationship have to do with her failed\
    \ relationship? Whole thing is weird."
  : '10636'
  ? Yeah, they make 0 sense. Hustle culture people say work is inherently good and
    virtuous without aim. Then when you say then why would no one work unless forced
    to? It completely destroys their argument.
  : '13678'
  Yeah, this article forgets that Trump and the Republicans don't actually consider Europeans their allies.: '13653'
  ? Yeah, this is much less stressful. I get the feeling we are going to see a lot
    of trolls and fake news going hard at Macron for the next couple weeks though.
  : '6468'
  Yeah, this is one of Macron's big proposals (making firing easier) and I think it's gonna be tough to get through.: '6293'
  ? Yeah, this is pretty much it.  Just understand that when you start being real
    you will start to notice people treating you better.
  : '11812'
  Yeah, we get it, the globalists are preparing an excuse for a landslide Le Pen victory.: '1375'
  ? Yeah, we might get some populist proposing sanctions on other EU countries and
    calling them out on "social dumping" and that would be just terrible. Fortunately
    there are non-populists like Macron who will take upon themselves to do those
    things so that we can mercifully avoid those things.
  : '5201'
  ? "Yeah, we shouldn\u2019t give a shit what she says. We all hate Trump for how\
    \ cruel he is yet she hates him because he isn\u2019t cruel enough. \n\nFuck Ann\
    \ Coulter."
  : '17577'
  ? 'Yeah, whitelisting is way better.

    When it comes to evading blacklists, if 13year old me managed it, I think it''s
    possible these people could, if they were that determined to do it.'
  : '12184'
  ? "Yeah, who dates a family member\u2019s ex without previously checking with the\
    \ family member if it is ok? \n\nNever mind... who dates a family member\u2019\
    s ex at all. Ever. \n\nNTA"
  : '11105'
  Yeah, you can even skip some gens I think like 2 to 4?: '10880'
  ? Yeah, you don't understand anything about economics. Melenchon openly admires
    Chavez, the guy responsible for the Venezuelan shitshow of an economy.
  : '6264'
  ? "Yeah, you\u2019re right. No one\u2019s managing, but they know it\u2019s going\
    \ on. I guarantee SOMEONE has a line item in a ledger SOMEWHERE, that accounts\
    \ for \u201CSpillage\u201D."
  : '8324'
  ? "Yeah. \n\nAlso, it's so sad we barely have time for our friends and family. It's\
    \ hard to get together because people often just want to rest after being done\
    \ work or the work schedules don't line up.\n\nWe work and then we die."
  : '16942'
  Yeah. Compared to [this former Foreign Minister](https://youtu.be/CTozrTpxldM)  Macrons English is spotless: '5978'
  ? Yeah. Give it a few more years. These student loan victims will reach a critical
    mass and either the board will get thrown or a govt bailout will be necessary.
    In what kind of intelligent civilization are the citizens rewarded for attempting
    betterment and productivity with indentured servitude. Fuck that shit. Dont pay
    your student loans.
  : '15170'
  ? Yeah. I'm a muslim and I don't think le pen will ever stop terrorist attacks completely.
    You don't know this but terrorists in groups like ISIS want far right candidates
    like Le Pen to win because they can then use them as an example to rally muslims
    against the western world because a lot of these candidates policies negatively
    affect Muslims. That is why terrorist groups like ISIS had videos that showed  donald
    trump I think during the US election campaign talking about his muslim ban and
    other things that can negatively affect Muslims.
  : '1339'
  ? "Yeah. I've spent a lot of time operating well outside of my area of expertise,\
    \ and it's exhausting.  I haven't got any advice - just - hang in there. Keep\
    \ notes - make yourself a cheatsheet or notebook or something - that can help.\
    \ \n\nI remember being a kid and just wanting to get away from home. I wish someone\
    \ had warned me how much being an adult would suck."
  : '14842'
  ? Yeah. It's like the old phrase, "god fearing man". They've been fetishizing ruling
    through power and fear for longer than the US has even been here.
  : '15288'
  ? "Yeah. She likely won\u2019t change her mind and if she does there\u2019s potential\
    \ that she\u2019ll resent you and/ the babies.. this is an easy one."
  : '11635'
  Yeah... unfortunately nobody is going to take this seriously who doesn't already agree.: '12574'
  ? 'Yeeeaah, if you take him back he''s still gonna cheat, he''s just going to be
    more careful so he doesn''t get caught. He proved how manipulative he is by crying
    for you to forgive him only to continue messaging the girl after ge dropped you
    off, like what come on now.


    Even though you said you guys have been together since you were 18, it seems like
    that doesn''t mean anything to him.'
  : '11200'
  Yellow poop can be an indication of liver disease right?: '8130'
  ? Yep I worked with a guy with this problem. We called him Nightmare. The lying
    wasn't even what made him miserable to work with, but it didn't help him make
    friends either. One of his recurring fables was that he was secretly very wealthy
    and owned a dozen dope sports cars, but he worked with us for ten bucks an hour
    and drove a beater truck full of rusty scrap because it "Looks better if you're
    busy during the day, you know?"
  : '7195'
  ? "Yep absolutely. I\u2019m 25 and will never forget when my father forgot my birthday.\
    \ He was an addict and although we speak now, I have a lot of resentment towards\
    \ him. Fix this while you can."
  : '7705'
  ? Yep my boss got pissed when she found out a coworker and I talked about our pay.
    They don't want us to know how arbitrary all our paychecks are and sure as hell
    don't want us using others pay to negotiate for raises.
  : '16717'
  ? "Yep my mom telling me I could be working instead of playing video games. When\
    \ I was 18 I would have worked a 36 hour work week and on my free day I\u2019\
    d play video games only to have my mom tell me I should be working to save up\
    \ money. Like Jesus Christ, if I don\u2019t even get one day a week to do my thing\
    \ then I\u2019m just going to kill myself. I\u2019m not gonna be a fucking slave\
    \ to Target of all places."
  : '14511'
  Yep! I used to love taking my fingernail and scraping off the lint. It was so damn satisfying.: '11939'
  ? Yep! Recommended, so long as you don't mind subtitles or speak French. It's very
    insightful and you get to see the more human side of Macron and his campaign.
  : '1739'
  ? "Yep, 70% of redditors aren't American.\n\nThey hate us cause they ain\u2019t\
    \ us."
  : '17182'
  Yep, I hope you get caught for the falsifying it OP. It would be great karma for a racist asshole like you.: '7961'
  Yep, I think they call it morals or having limits and standards. AOC probably doesn't understand that though: '13684'
  "Yep, as well as funding the extremists like Le Pen and M\xE9lenchon. ": '5265'
  "Yep, not anti-labor; more anti work-as-it-exists-as-an-institution. At least that\u2019s my perspective. \u2764\uFE0F": '14468'
  ? 'Yep, there''s inevitably going to be another terrorist attack in France, the
    only question is whether it''s going to be before the election or after the election.


    Macron may well easily this time, but if his presidency is riddled with terrorist
    attacks then people are going to find it very hard to vote for him again in the
    next elections.'
  : '3575'
  ? Yep, this is decades of mother-daughter enmeshment. Even if OPs wife recognized
    the issue and WANTED to change may take a long time. It is the wife's problem,
    but she probably can't even see the enormity of the issue and how badly it is
    affecting her and her marriage. Hopefully this will open her eyes. She'll need
    to unravel this ball of bullshit and manipulation in individual therapy.
  : '9606'
  ? Yep, this! That was a big ask even leaving aside the fact that OP had made it
    clear from the start that it was a total no-go for cultural reasons.
  : '11318'
  Yep, tons of people who put in the effort to learn instead of blaming the teachers and cheating.: '7265'
  Yep, won't affect your children personally so you can just wash your hands of it and pat yourself on the back. Congrats.: '14215'
  ? Yep.  Apparently they arrived on scene as her new ride showed up.  At least Lyft
    warned her that future reports of this nature would affect her account.
  : '14590'
  ? "Yep.  The Kremlin doesn't expect to install true puppets in the White House or\
    \ the \xC9lys\xE9e Palace (though Le Pen's passionate boot-licking might qualify\
    \ if that nightmare came to pass.)  Rather, Putin seeks to disrupt real democracies,\
    \ to instill fear and distrust to weaken their ability to counter his expansion,\
    \ and also to tear down everyone around Russia to make it look better in comparison."
  : '3147'
  ? Yep.  Trump supporters are called Russian bots.  Now it looks like Le Pen supporters
    are just fake accounts.  They'll do anything they can to dehumanize their opposition.
  : '1268'
  ? Yep. A full couch seat with seat belts so we could stare at the cars behind us
    and what I usually thought was making the drivers and passengers uncomfortable.
    Sometimes they would make us laugh. Sometimes they would flip us off.
  : '9026'
  Yep. And half the kids would walk back to their desks saying "yessssssss.": '11462'
  ? 'Yep. Anti-Trump Republicans hate his mannerisms and disparaging of typical GOP
    pandering targets like the military and the elderly.


    They still like the policies. Just not the man.'
  : '17019'
  "Yep. California does have the effect of pushing people who don\u2019t get brainwashed easily to the right": '16803'
  ? Yep. Every workaholic says they're workaholic. Do they have hobbies, emotions,
    feelings? Maybe they just have anxiety inside and need to cover it with the work
    so that they cover also their insecurities? Maybe they just love working... I
    don't know.
  : '12906'
  ? "Yep. Friday night was 'pizza night' and I would watch this line up and eat pizza\
    \ on the only night that I was allowed to eat in front of the tv. \n\nThe little\
    \ things..."
  : '8137'
  ? "Yep. Glad you're alive and didn't hurt anyone else. Always drop the mag, rack\
    \ repeatedly, and visually ensure chamber is clear before manipulating the firearm.\
    \ \n\nAlso, make sure to sand and then paint the spackle for a seamless repair."
  : '10720'
  ? Yep. I always think to myself, why these poor fucks gotta procreate. It's not
    like you have abundance in money or anything like that. Just keep me out of it.
    But no. I forgive them though, partially, they couldn't control their desires.
    Get protection next time, stupid bastards.
  : '16778'
  Yep. I could do my job just as well sitting but some boomer decided that standing looks more friendly or something.: '14152'
  ? Yep. I feel like the psychological aspect of it is huge. The can design, bottle
    shape, materials and colors all contribute to the way you perceive it tasting
  : '10614'
  Yep. I guess they really do work. It's le Pen or whatever her name is.: '6549'
  Yep. If all workers quit and form an organization, then they could dictate the price for labor.: '13589'
  ? "Yep. It\u2019s crazy how so many evil people thought they were doing the right\
    \ thing. The road to hell really is paved with good intentions. Can\u2019t beat\
    \ good old fashioned conviction...or delusion? Both."
  : '16397'
  ? Yep. Just because a woman is running doesn't mean women should just vote for her.
    How stupid is that? "Oh, it doesn't matter what she stands for...she's a woman!
    How can you not vote for her??" So FREAKING stupid. No one *should* vote for anyone
    based on their gender/income/race/lifestyle.
  : '13089'
  ? "Yep. Like they said in the newest Star Wars. \n\n\"They win by making you feel\
    \ like you're alone.\""
  : '14104'
  ? "Yep. The nerve to take the hour in the middle of the day that you need to take\
    \ a breather and eat and not count that toward my hours. \n\nBitch, I am out here\
    \ tired and hungry because you are making me do things. You should be paying me\
    \ to be out of my house AND paying for my food."
  : '13237'
  ? 'Yes I agree. Sorry if it was not clear enough.



    I am talking of the 3 ''winners'' of this election:


    *En Marche with Macron the new French president. Moderate center party.


    *France Insoumise with Melanchon. A very left leaning party.


    *Front National with Le Pen. A far right  party.'
  : '5131'
  ? Yes I do, thankfully. My grandma and aunt across the street. I'm afraid any nasty
    comments wouldn't go away if I were to stay with them, since they both believe
    in the "pretty skirts and dresses should always be worn by girls" and they say
    i look homeless with my grungey baggy clothes. Thankfully my mom has calmed down
    about it and hasn't threatened to kick me out again, but we also haven't spoken
    about it since.
  : '7591'
  ? Yes I forgot to mention that, because the baby was involved, the police have to
    contact the dept of children services. Even if for some reason I wanted to stay
    with my wife while continuing to exhibit this behavior, they would take our daughter
    from both of us
  : '11690'
  ? Yes I know, and as I said, I'm sure Russia would've prefered Melenchon over many
    of the other candidates, just not more than they'd prefer Le Pen.
  : '3520'
  Yes I was being sarcastic. The media likes to chastise poor people for owning appliances.: '14371'
  ? Yes Jews seem to think that white hatred is a good thing for them forgetting that
    they are considered white by most non whites.  I would go as far as to say that
    Jews seem to be the ones pushing most of the white hatred see adl splc and pretty
    much any other Jewish ran organization.
  : '16053'
  'Yes Putin, invade Chechnya again because Macron said so. I''m sure that''s the best option available. ': '1724'
  Yes YTA but that's hardly surprising because your mother is also an asshole so apples and trees.....: '10269'
  Yes all those things should also be free you absolute fucking dolt.: '12652'
  ? Yes as everyone says It sounds like him hiding his money was a good idea, but
    we should acknowledge that someone secretely making such huge interventions in
    her life must feel extremely weird, as well intentioned as he was.
  : '8700'
  ? 'Yes because Le Pen would''ve personally stopped every future terrorist attack


    Everyone knows that'
  : '5556'
  "Yes because only people that agree with you deserve to be able to fight the fallout from this pandemic. \U0001F644": '14358'
  ? Yes but he didn't win, that's the point, even if people was but look at Trump!
    I am not trying to say Le Pen will not win, I am saying she will not win at the
    first round if nothing crazy happen. Melenchon have as much chance as her to win
    the first round in this case. Do you think she can win 25% of the vote in two
    week? In this cas Macron can do this, Melenchon can too, and maybe Hamon will
    too...
  : '6970'
  Yes but he would still have evil values and policies.: '13034'
  Yes especially that too. Your entire livelihood is subject to the whims of some bullshit algorithm.: '12916'
  ? Yes he does. Melenchon is a virulent opponent to Macron, they disagree on pretty
    much everything. Hamon agrees on some stuff but disagrees on many of the key points
    of Macron's platform such as labour market reform. The center right disagrees
    on a number of things but is fully on board with those essential aspects. So,
    tactics aside, governing with the center right (together with the center left,
    but they mostly already joined him) makes far more sense for Macron than trying
    to work with Hamon.
  : '3516'
  ? 'Yes it fucking is! That is literally the point of minimum wage! [Roosevelt said
    it was when established the minimum wage.](https://images.app.goo.gl/85Ym8P9B1nN6HwJb7)


    (That''s from [this speech](http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/odnirast.html) just
    so you know nothing''s out of context)


    If you work full time, you deserve a living wage! To say certain people don''t
    deserve a living wage is to imply they don''t deserve to live!'
  : '15013'
  ? "Yes it is a human. It\u2019s not an adult, or born. But it\u2019s definitely\
    \ human. You think it\u2019s a goat during the fetus stage or something? It\u2019\
    s 100% a human fetus."
  : '13617'
  ? Yes it is sad for us international students and all the legal workers in here
    but in the situation i understand why the government would want to focus on citizens
    rather than on us.
  : '16603'
  Yes it is schoolwork, for which class I cannot say because personal info: '14923'
  ? 'Yes it''s weird. But so is being the 39 year old president of The Fifth Republic.
    If it doesn''t effect his job performance, then there''s not much to say about
    it that hasn''t already been discussed.


    No sane person is gonna voluntarily run the gauntlet of sadistic voyeurism and
    degradation that modern political campaigns have become, so if that''s Macron''s
    only serious quirk then I''ll consider him shockingly even-keeled.'
  : '4826'
  Yes just make sure to roll down your window and share some with any kids nearby.: '9251'
  ? 'Yes on the first, the second doesn''t have any hard proof, but Russia is the
    only entity that would benefit from Le Pen, and her party is funded through loans
    from a Russian state controlled bank. '
  : '6114'
  Yes please go vote, betting rates for LePen vs Macron are 8.5:1.: '4698'
  ? Yes please... our economy is based on this model... Macron would put us in the
    poor house and company's would still go to Germany over France.
  : '4449'
  Yes that is why we call it wage slavery and been trying to abolish it for centuries: '13191'
  Yes that's French they're speaking, but they're not French; they're American: '10604'
  ? "Yes that's bad.\n\nBut like...and this is an extreme example:\n\nLet's pretend\
    \ someone raped someone close to you. \n\nYou're going to go with feels over rationality\
    \ I guarantee you. \n\nFor McConnel the senate was basically raped lol"
  : '13811'
  ? 'Yes that''s what I mean by thumped. The polls currently put Macron ahead of Le
    Pen by ~20-30 pts, which is a bit better than losing by an insane landslide like
    Jean-Marie, but it''s just such a large margin that polling error alone isn''t
    really enough here. It''d be like if Trump had actually won California or New
    York in 2016. '
  : '4381'
  ? "Yes there is a leftist narrative, yes there is a right narrative - the media\
    \ are corporate entities with interests.   But that is getting off topic - \n\n\
    Not everyone you disagree with is from the \"far right\" - Le Pen is absolutely\
    \ a moderate civic nationalist - fearmongering doesn't help anything. "
  : '3073'
  Yes this is in no way an overstatement. Sexually deviant behavior for sure.: '11391'
  ? "Yes this is really important and maybe explains a lots. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry\
    \ you\u2019re all going through this. Your husbands outlook and behaviour is very\
    \ bizarre and worrying."
  : '12448'
  ? "Yes to all of this. She\u2019s even told OP that she\u2019s \u201Cprotecting\u201D\
    \ him by not telling him what she\u2019s doing up there because if he knew it\
    \ would be \u201Cupsetting\u201D for him \u2014 which is exactly the kind of nonsense\
    \ people say when they\u2019re doing shady shit they don\u2019t want anyone to\
    \ know about. She\u2019s *already* being distrustful."
  : '11678'
  ? Yes to the recording of conversation, you need to do that. And if you can afford
    it maybe talk to a laywer who specializes in custody cases about this?
  : '7548'
  ? "Yes we can and that's not what is questioned here. \n\nHe is pointing out that\
    \ Hollande made his work easier by actually going out of his way to do things\
    \ he was not necessarily required to do to help them do their job even if it could\
    \ have been damaging for him. "
  : '4390'
  ? Yes we think of inflation. That does not change the fact that I would eat my socks
    to be able to buy a bigmac for 65 cents right now.
  : '8831'
  Yes within the logic of capitalism, killing people to make money makes complete sense.: '16156'
  Yes you did the right thing. Want some advice, don't go around calling your pedophile friends "good guys" in public.: '11337'
  ? "Yes you were stupid. Dumb as a fucking rock. About as useful as a dick-flavored\
    \ popsicle. \n\nBut guess what? Literally every single person alive that went\
    \ to high school, was a fucking dumbass when they were in high school. We\u2019\
    ve all done things we regret. \n\nYou\u2019re good my friend. Carry on, go forth,\
    \ and remember your lesson."
  : '11113'
  ? Yes you're right, there's a conspiracy theory among terrorists to get Le Pen elected.
    It's not at all far more likely that terrorists are just terrorizing without any
    objective beyond terrifying.
  : '2469'
  Yes your father is a weak man and his life choice reflect that fact pretty well.: '11885'
  Yes! And he also created millions of jobs by starting WW2. Wow what a stimulus! I love job creators!: '15808'
  Yes! And they all had some basic form of this movement: '8882'
  ? 'Yes! But these people who voted for le pen aren''t all full blown racist. These
    populist nationalist appeal to many people based on many small issues. Immigration,
    refugees, and economic uncertainty ought to be addressed because obviously the
    French people and many Europeans are concerned about their ways of life. '
  : '855'
  ? "Yes! I had them and they smelled terrible. \n\nBut the pizza smell... I miss\
    \ mid-1990s Pizza Hut."
  : '8829'
  Yes! I have a huge sense memory tied to those muffins: '7984'
  Yes! My back is itching right now thinking about it.: '8942'
  "Yes! They\u2019re really not sjws, they\u2019re just diehard communists dedicated to the destruction of the bourgeois.": '17291'
  "Yes, 100%. She stole from children for profit. She lied about what it was it for, it\u2019s then stealing. Please report her": '10567'
  ? 'Yes, Benoit Hamon. But Macron is good enough. Anybody is not willing to sale
    their country would be good enough. Unlike Fascist Le Pen who was ready to sell
    to the Putin mafia. '
  : '6432'
  ? Yes, I am empathetic to the fact that people handle situations like that in very
    different ways way. My response was very narrowminded in that regard.
  : '8400'
  Yes, I did this.  Why did we do it?  Those were simpler times.: '12393'

  ? Yes, because mothers are more likely to be the SAHP... hence the data showing
    that. In this particular case, the father is the primary caregiver, so he'd be
    statistically more likely to get custody. If the mother were primary caregiver,
    they'd be more statistically likely. Do you yet understand how this works? It
    is skewed towards mothers because mothers statistically are more likely to be
    primary caregivers, it is not based off of gender though.

  Yes, bribing the American people with their own tax dollars. Susan Collins said he learned his lesson though.: '13677'
  ? 'Yes, but I don''t think that''s why people voted against him. Wilders gave zero
    practical solutions to the problems that every day citizens face. He complained,

    are the problem'', it didn''t matter what the issue was. The economy? Muslims
    are the problem. Crime? Muslims are the problem. Poverty? Muslims are the problem.

    leaks because there is nothing there.
  : '3273'
  ? Yes, but those are not the complaints which drove Le Pen's campaign, or Brexit.
    They were down to scaremongering stories about immigrants and waves of rapists

    many are not real, but fanned by ulterior motives.

  : '16712'
  ? Yes, it's understandable for the victims' loved ones to be in immense pain, and

  : '17739'
  ? 'Yes, right now the polish company pays polish wages. With Macrons concept they
